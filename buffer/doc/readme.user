To use Dimsim Buffer with CIMA, 
1. Replace CIMA Director bean with Dimsim bean 'DimsimCIMADirector'
2. Instantiate a Buffer instance. Either DeliveryBuffer or ListDeliveryBuffer depending on what functions are required.
3. To access methods declared in the IDeliveryBufer Interface, 
	3.1 If accessing from the same JVM, obtain Buffer Bean instance and invoke IDelivery(/List)Buffer interface methods.	     
	3.2 If accessing from different JVM
	    3.2.1 Extend AbstractDimsimConsumerPlugin class to create a new consumer 
	    3.2.2 Instantiate consumer bean
	    3.2.3 On the source JVM, instantiate BufferPlugin (or ListBufferPlugin)
	    3.2.4 Fire away Command Operations to Buffer Plugin from Consumer using methods available 
	          in AbstractDimsimConsumerPlugin


To enable EndPointSecurity
1. If Security is enabled in DimsimCIMADirector, subscription requests will be denied for all consumer/url/plugin 
   tuples not defined to EndPointSubscriptionSecurityModel.	             
2. For static declaration of security tuples, view Bean definition and constructor args in resource buffers.xml 
   for Class EndpointSubscriptionSecurityModel.
3. Dynamic addition and deletion of security tuples is possible by invoking 'add' methods defined in the 
   interface IEndPointSecurity. Since this requires access to IEndPointSecurity bean instance, dynamic changes to \
   security is restricted to JVM at source-end.
   
To Buffer at Consumer End
 1. AbstractDimsimConsumerPlugin provides methods for buffering incoming parcels. 
    One use case for this function is arrival of out of order parcels. Consumer plugin can now buffer such parcels
    and wait until the required parcels arrive. Consumer Plugins can also choose to send a request to Source 
    BufferPlugin for required parcels.
